# ToDoList
Node.js Learning Journey

######################################################################

This project is my first step into Node.js and full-stack development.

I built a real-time To-Do List application to learn:
+ Node.js & Express.js
+ MongoDB & Mongoose
+ JWT Authentication
+ Role-based authorization
+ REST API structure
+ React frontend integration
+ Socket.IO for real-time updates
+ Understanding CRUD operations deeply
+ Managing state between frontend and backend
+ Real-world authorization scenarios
+ Multi-user project management
+ Backend data relationships and access control

The main goal of this project is learning by building and understanding
how backend and frontend communicate in a real application.

Features:
+ User registration and login
+ JWT based authentication
+ Protected routes
+ Project based To-Do lists
+ Real-time updates between users
+ Role and permission management
+ Creating projects for organizing tasks
+ Adding To-Do items under specific projects
+ Linking projects and tasks to authenticated users
+ Backend API endpoints for project and todo management
+ Frontend dashboard for listing and selecting projects
+ Synchronization between frontend and backend using REST APIs
+ Implemented full Project CRUD architecture (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
+ Added ability to invite/add participants to projects
+ Participants have limited access based on role
+ Improved data modeling between Projects, Users, and To-Do items
+ Strengthened authorization logic to ensure secure access to project resources
